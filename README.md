# Calculator

## A calculator that can perform all of the basic math functions usually found in simple calculators

The final assignment from the Foundations course in The Odin Project.
The aim of this project was to combine all of the skills practiced throughout the foundations course, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Assignment Requirements:

- Functions for basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Buttons for all digits, equals, and a 'clear' button
- A display to show the user inputs and operation results
- User can string together several operations before pressing 'equals', with each pair of numbers evaluated in order (e.g., 5 + 3 * 2 = 16) 
- Round answers with long decimals to avoid overflowing the screen
- An error message if the user divides a number by zero

### Assignment Extra Credit:

- A decimal point button that is disabled when there is already a decimal on the display
- A backspace button

### Additional Features: 

- Percentage button
- A '+/-' button to allow changing numbers between positive and negative    
- A toggle to switch between light and dark theme
